[{"content":"Welcome, friend Somehow you got here. Maybe you already know me, or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re curious to learn more.\nLet me tell you a bit about myself.\nThe beginning I studied artificial intelligence in college (a long 5 years). Got my first YC startup job at 20. There, I discovered a real passion for the business side of software \u0026amp; AI. Started as a tech lead at koble when there was just a figma design and we build the MVP. Nowadays 2024 and I\u0026rsquo;m now Head of AI at Koble, pretty cool right. I just finished my 5-year college program in AI engineering, and I\u0026rsquo;m presenting my thesis next week. I built a SaaS based on my thesis, called Sourcechat.io. So, I\u0026rsquo;m also the founder and (kind of) CEO. Over the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve met really interesting people in the startup/business ecosystem, and I want to keep connecting with awesome folks. Personal stuff I\u0026rsquo;m more into audiobooks than books, finishing around 5 per month. I have a rescue dog called Nina. I really enjoy movies and have a huge list if you\u0026rsquo;d like a recommendation. I\u0026rsquo;m into general fitness, especially weights and some martial arts.

This current is shaped by fears and challenges. The river itself represents the masses, those guided by their environment, lacking their own values or the will to forge a different path.\nMost people spend their lives swept along by this current, until they reach a sudden waterfall. The fall – emotional, physical, or financial – becomes inevitable.\nTo avoid the fall The only way to prevent this fall is to awaken a force within, one that allows you to resist the flow of life and forge your own path, your own destiny.\nTo awaken this force, you will need:\nDefine what you want. \u0026ldquo;What would I go for if I knew I could not fail\u0026rdquo;. Find your limiting beliefs. Replace those beliefs with empowering beliefs. Change your neuro association Link Pleasure to action Link Pain to inaction \u0026ldquo;The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you\u0026rdquo;\nMy Thoughts: The book is alright. It presents a very simple yet effective idea. While getting it to work was harder than expected, it does deliver results. Tony is a role model and inspiration to many, and he\u0026rsquo;s rightfully earned that respect. His teachings come from his own experience and that has double merit.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/awaken_the_giant_within/","summary":"Go with the flow Tony refers to life as a river, constantly in motion, carrying you along with its current.

Maybe you already know me, or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re curious to learn more.\nLet me tell you a bit about myself.\nThe beginning I studied artificial intelligence in college (a long 5 years). Got my first YC startup job at 20. There, I discovered a real passion for the business side of software \u0026amp; AI. Started as a tech lead at koble when there was just a figma design and we build the MVP. Nowadays 2024 and I\u0026rsquo;m now Head of AI at Koble, pretty cool right. I just finished my 5-year college program in AI engineering, and I\u0026rsquo;m presenting my thesis next week. I built a SaaS based on my thesis, called Sourcechat.io. So, I\u0026rsquo;m also the founder and (kind of) CEO. Over the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve met really interesting people in the startup/business ecosystem, and I want to keep connecting with awesome folks. Personal stuff I\u0026rsquo;m more into audiobooks than books, finishing around 5 per month. I have a dog called Nina. I really enjoy movies and have a huge list if you\u0026rsquo;d like a recommendation. I\u0026rsquo;m into general fitness, especially weights and some martial arts.

      <description>Go with the flow Tony refers to life as a river, constantly in motion, carrying you along with its current. This current is shaped by fears and challenges. The river itself represents the masses, those guided by their environment, lacking their own values or the will to forge a different path.
Most people spend their lives swept along by this current, until they reach a sudden waterfall. The fall – emotional, physical, or financial – becomes inevitable.</description>

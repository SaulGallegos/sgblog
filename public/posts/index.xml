      <description>I created a new company called sourcechat.io.
Maybe &amp;lsquo;company&amp;rsquo; is a bit broad, Sourcechat is a Saas, someone could even argue that is a micro-saas because the only purpose of it is to give early founders an affordable and smart AI chatbot for their websites.
I think is a great product
Anyone can get started for free No credit card needed You can setup a chatbot in a couple of minutes And only if you found the chatbot useful you can upgrade to a premium plan.</description>

      <description>Go with the flow Tony refers to life as a river, constantly in motion, carrying you along with its current. This current is shaped by fears and challenges. The river itself represents the masses, those guided by their environment, lacking their own values or the will to forge a different path.
Most people spend their lives swept along by this current, until they reach a sudden waterfall. The fall – emotional, physical, or financial – becomes inevitable.</description>

      <description>Welcome, friend Somehow you got here. Maybe you already know me, or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re curious to learn more.
Let me tell you a bit about myself.
The beginning I studied artificial intelligence in college (a long 5 years). Got my first YC startup job at 20. There, I discovered a real passion for the business side of software &amp;amp; AI. Started as a tech lead at koble when there was just a figma design and we build the MVP.</description>

I created a new company called [sourcechat.io](https://sourcechat.io).

Maybe 'company' is a bit broad, Sourcechat is a Saas, someone could even argue that is a micro-saas because the only purpose of it is to give early founders an affordable and smart AI chatbot for their websites.

I think is a great product

- Anyone can get started for free
- No credit card needed
- You can setup a chatbot in a couple of minutes
- And only if you found the chatbot useful you can upgrade to a premium plan.

So if you're a founder or owner of a small or medium-size business and want a fast and affordable chatbot in your website..... Check [sourcechat.io](https://sourcechat.io)

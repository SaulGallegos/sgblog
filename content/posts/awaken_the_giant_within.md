## Go with the flow

Tony refers to life as a river, constantly in motion, carrying you along with its current. This current is shaped by fears and challenges. The river itself represents the masses, those guided by their environment, lacking their own values or the will to forge a different path.

Most people spend their lives swept along by this current, until they reach a sudden waterfall. The fall – emotional, physical, or financial – becomes inevitable.

## To avoid the fall

The only way to prevent this fall is to awaken a force within, one that allows you to resist the flow of life and forge your own path, your own destiny.

To awaken this force, you will need:

- Define what you want. "What would I go for if I knew I could not fail".
- Find your limiting beliefs.
- Replace those beliefs with empowering beliefs.
- Change your neuro association
  - Link **Pleasure** to **action**
  - Link **Pain** to **inaction**

> "The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you"

**My Thoughts:** The book is alright. It presents a very simple yet effective idea. While getting it to work was harder than expected, it does deliver results. Tony is a role model and inspiration to many, and he's rightfully earned that respect. His teachings come from his own experience and that has double merit.

# Welcome, friend

Somehow you got here. Maybe you already know me, or maybe you're curious to learn more.

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

## The beginning

- I studied artificial intelligence in college (a long 5 years).
- Got my first YC startup job at 20. There, I discovered a real passion for the business side of software & AI.
- Started as a tech lead at koble when there was just a figma design and we build the MVP.

## Nowadays

- 2024 and I'm now Head of AI at Koble, pretty cool right.
- I just finished my 5-year college program in AI engineering, and I'm presenting my thesis next week.
- I built a SaaS based on my thesis, called Sourcechat.io. So, I'm also the founder and (kind of) CEO.
- Over the past couple of years, I've met really interesting people in the startup/business ecosystem, and I want to keep connecting with awesome folks.

## Personal stuff

- I'm more into audiobooks than books, finishing around 5 per month.
- I have a rescue dog called Nina.
- I really enjoy movies and have a huge list if you'd like a recommendation.
- I'm into general fitness, especially weights and some martial arts.
